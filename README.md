# Welcome

Welcome to my Github pages. Here you'll find some of my sample projects. Please click on the project folder to see the code & demo.

# PortConfig

The PortConfig project was my little side project I voluntarily created for our technical writer while I was still employed at Jupiter Systems in late 2012. He wants to print different network port configuration worksheet in PDF, so I created this stand alone web app for him.

## Demo

Note: after clicking the Print button, refresh the page to show the configuration dialog window again.
