# Welcome

Welcome to my Github pages. Here you'll find some of my sample projects. Please click on the project folder to see the code & demo.

# PortConfig project

The PortConfig project was my little side project I voluntarily created for our technical writer while I was still employed at Jupiter Systems in late 2012. He wants to print different network port configuration worksheet in PDF, so I created this stand alone web app for him.

## Demo

Note: after clicking the Print button, refresh the page to show the configuration dialog window again.

# BookManger Interview project

The BookManager Interview project was given to me by my former employer Jupiter Systems in May 2012 as a take home/one day interview project. I was asked to build a web app that allows user to add a book to the collection. Each book in the collection should have a Title, Author, Year and Price. The web app project must be written in JavaScript, JSON, Ajax, Html & CSS that can run without a real server. Some UI validation is a bonus.

## Demo

Note: click on any existing row to edit the book or add button (top corner left) to add a new book.

## Usability Theory

I wrote this article in 2012 and I hope it's still useful to share.
