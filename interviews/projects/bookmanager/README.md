# BookManager Interview Project

The BookManager project was given to me by my former employer Jupiter Systems as a take home/one day interview project. 
I was asked to build a web app that allows user to add a book to the collection. Each book in the collection should have 
a Title, Author, Year and Price. The web app project must be written in JavaScript, JSON, Ajax, Html & CSS that can run 
without a real server. Some UI validation is a bonus.

# Demo

This BookManager web app project is in its original state, I haven't touched/modified it since May 2012. Note: click on any existing row to edit the book or add button (top corner left) to add a new book.
