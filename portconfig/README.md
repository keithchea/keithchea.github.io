# PortConfig
The PortConfig project was my little side project I voluntarily created for our technical writer while I was still employed at Jupiter Systems. He wants to print different network port configuration worksheet in PDF, so I created this stand alone web app for him.

# Demo
The UI of this stand alone web app was not refined and was intended for printing only. Note: after clicking the Print button, refresh the page to show the configuration dialog window again.
